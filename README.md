# KinaOperyTeatry

Main purpose of KinaOperyTeatry is to deliver information about cultural events in Cracow. To accomplish this we use Scrapy to retrieve data from other websites such us http://www.opera.krakow.pl. Collected data are stored in PostgreSQL database. In KinoOperyTeatry we used Django-REST-framwork to communicate between front and back-end. In the near future we are going to add scrappers and make interface more user friendly.
